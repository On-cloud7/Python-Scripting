# Python and Shell Scripting

## 🐍 What is Python Scripting?

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.  
**Python scripting** refers to writing Python programs to automate tasks, process data, or build applications.

### Key Features
- Easy to learn and beginner-friendly
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Large standard library and third-party modules
- Widely used in DevOps, Cloud, Automation, and Data Engineering

### Common Use Cases
- Automation (log analysis, backups, monitoring)
- Cloud & DevOps automation (AWS using boto3)
- CI/CD pipeline scripting
- API integration and data processing

### Example Python Script
```python
print("Hello, DevOps World!")


# Shell Scripting

## 🖥️ What is Shell Scripting?

**Shell scripting** is the practice of writing scripts using a command-line shell (most commonly **Bash**) to automate tasks in **Linux/Unix-based systems**.

A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of commands that the shell executes line by line.
