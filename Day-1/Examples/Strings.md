# String Data Type in Python

## 1. String Data Type

A **string** in Python is a sequence of characters used to represent textual data.  
Strings are enclosed within single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes.  
Triple quotes are mainly used for multi-line text.

Strings in Python are **immutable**, which means once a string is created, its content cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.

Each character in a string is stored at a specific position called an **index**, starting from zero. Indexing allows access to individual characters.

Python provides many built-in functions and methods to work with strings, such as finding length, changing case, removing spaces, or replacing characters.

## 2. String Manipulation and Formatting

### Concatenation
Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings to form a single string.

---

### Substrings
A substring is a smaller part extracted from a larger string.

---

### Slicing
**Slicing** is the method used to extract a portion of a string by specifying a range of indexes.  
The starting index is included, while the ending index is excluded.  
Slicing is commonly used to obtain specific sections of a string.

---

### String Interpolation
**String interpolation** is the technique of inserting variables or values directly into a string.  
It makes strings dynamic and readable, and avoids manual string joining.  
Python supports multiple interpolation methods, including modern, older, and function-based approaches.

---

### Escape Sequences
Escape sequences are special character combinations used to represent characters that cannot be typed directly, such as new lines, tabs, or quotation marks.  
They begin with a backslash and are interpreted specially within strings.

---

### String Methods
Python provides several built-in string methods to manipulate text efficiently.  
Common operations include splitting a string into parts, joining multiple strings, and checking how a string starts or ends.

## Summary
Strings in Python are immutable sequences of characters that support indexing, slicing, formatting, and a wide range of built-in methods for effective text handling.
