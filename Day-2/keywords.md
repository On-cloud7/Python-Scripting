- `for` – Iterates over a sequence  
- `while` – Executes code while a condition is true  
- `break` – Terminates a loop  
- `continue` – Skips the current iteration  
- `pass` – Acts as a placeholder  

---

## Function & Class Keywords
- `def` – Defines a function  
- `return` – Sends a value back from a function  
- `lambda` – Creates an anonymous function  
- `class` – Defines a class  
- `yield` – Returns a value from a generator
